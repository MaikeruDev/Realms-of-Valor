# Realms-of-Valor

Realms-of-Valor is a text-based adventure game where you embark on a journey as a battle mage to retrieve a rare gem hidden deep in a cave. The gem is said to grant unimaginable power, and you are determined to be the one to claim it. The game world consists of different rooms with unique descriptions and interactions. Explore, interact with NPCs, solve puzzles, and overcome challenges to uncover the gem's secrets.

## How It Works

1. **Game Mechanics:** The game is controlled via text-based commands. Enter commands like "go north," "take key," "use potion," "talk to Bob," and more to explore the world and interact with objects and NPCs.

2. **Rooms and Exits:** Each room is defined with a description, information, exits (possible directions to move), items, objects, hints, requirements, and requirement messages.

3. **NPCs:** Interact with non-player characters (NPCs) to discover more about the story and receive information, items, or hints. Each NPC has its own name, appearance, dialogue, and response options.

4. **Inventory:** The game features an inventory system with categories like keys, weapons, potions, and general items to manage your collected items.

5. **Saving and Loading:** You can save your progress at any time and load it later to continue your adventure.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/maikerudev/Realms-of-Valor.git`

# Contributing

My intention of creating Realms-of-Valor was testing out the (to that time) relatively new Artificial Intelligence: ChatGPT. I only gave him instructions on what to add. I did not add a single line of code myself.
